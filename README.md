## sbt project compiled with Scala 3

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).


sbt "run {path to output directory}"

data/compressed:
- furyOutput.tgz: Fury format files generated by converting the JSON to Fury and writing the output
- jsonOutput.tgz: JSON output initially gathered from ClarinetSim

Fury serialization/deserialization:
- https://github.com/apache/fury/blob/main/docs/guide/scala_guide.md
- Much faster to load than JSON â€” about 8-10 seconds vs 3ish minutes
